# Melanoma-Diagnosis-Using-Lesion-Segmentation
Implemented the U-net architecture to work on the ISIC challenge, where you segment lesions (foreground) out of dermoscopic images.

Using Resnet V2 pretrained weights on imagenet as intial weights to the unet architecture the model got and IOU on the test set = 0.7631
